explains why design patterns were chosen
Module 10 https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/common-patterns.html
##### decided to include require statements in first line of each function,
to fail as soon as possible and always throw an exception

included selfdestruct function
circuit breaker, freeze contract if bugs are found

include modifiers so that only certain accounts can run certain functions

State Machine design pattern not necessary
